🚀 ReqMind AI
AI-Powered Business Requirements Document Generator

RAG | FastAPI | FAISS | Gemini | Cloud Deploymentt

🔍 Overview

ReqMind AI is a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that automatically transforms unstructured communication (meeting transcripts, emails, Slack chats) into structured, traceable, enterprise-grade Business Requirements Documents (BRDs).

It demonstrates applied skills in:

Large Language Models (LLMs)

RAG architecture design

Vector search (FAISS)

Prompt engineering

Backend API development (FastAPI)

Cloud deployment (Google Cloud Run)

System pipeline design

Confidence-based human-in-the-loop validation

🎯 Problem Statement

Requirement documentation in real-world projects is:

Manual and time-consuming

Prone to ambiguity and misinterpretation

Difficult to trace back to original discussions

Lacking structured conflict detection

**ReqMind AI automates this process while preserving traceability and interpretability.**

The system is built as a 9-stage intelligent pipeline:

Input Ingestion – Supports transcripts, email threads, Slack chats, AMI dataset

Rule-Based Preprocessing – Speaker segmentation + filler removal

RAG Chunking – Semantic chunk creation with overlap

Embedding Generation – SentenceTransformers (MiniLM)

Vector Indexing – FAISS for similarity search

LLM Extraction – Gemini extracts structured requirements

Conflict Detection – LLM-assisted contradiction detection

BRD Template Generation – Structured enterprise-ready format

Executive Summary Generation – Context-aware summarization
